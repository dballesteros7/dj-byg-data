  \section{Introduction}
    The general aim of this project is to develop a system able to produce
    information out of data extracted from songs. This is the general
    aim of the research field known as Music Information Retrieval (MIR),
    this field has been active for quite some time \cite{nameThatTune:1993}
    and its applications can be seen in several commercial products such as
    Pandora or Spotify \cite{recommendation:2010}.

    A great portion of the activity in MIR deals with song meta-data and audio
    features \cite{McFee:2012:MSD:2187980.2188222}. However, in this project we
    focus on lyrics as the main source of data.
    The main task that we pursue is to answer the following question:
    
    "Is it possible to determine the genre of a song based solely on its
    lyrics?"
     
    In order to accomplish this, we first explored how to extract genre
    information from the songs' lyrics and then evaluated the quality of the
    judgments. Lastly we made the developed methods available as a web
    application where arbitrary lyrics can be input in order to obtain
    a genre prediction.
    
    The report is organized as follows, first we present the input datasets used
    for the task and their respective pre-processing and manipulation. We then
    proceed to briefly explain the computing and analysis techniques chosen for
    the task. In the third section we present details of the implementation of
    these techniques. Finally the obtained results and the performance of the
    algorithms is discussed.
  \section{Data}
    \subsection{Description}
    In order to carry out the previously stated task, we selected the Million
    Songs Dataset (MSD) \cite{Bertin-Mahieux2011}.
    This dataset is a free collection of audio features and metadata for a million
    of tracks, it was collected by the LabROSA at Columbia University using
    the EchoNest API
    \footnote{A music intelligence platform - \url{http://the.echonest.com/}}.
    
    However, the main dataset contains only song metadata
    (e.g. artist and album) and audio features which are not of interest
    for this project. Fortunately, the dataset is accompanied by four companion
    datasets:
    
    \begin{description}
      \item[SecondHandSongs] List of cover songs within the MSD.
      \item[Taste profile] User data from EchoNest for a subset of the MSD.
      \item[musiXmatch] Lyrics for the songs in the MSD
                        \footnote{Lyrics are available only in bag of word
                                  representation due to copyright}.
      \item[Last.fm] Tags and similarity information for songs in the MSD.
    \end{description}
    
    Of interest for the current task are the last two datasets. The musiXmatch
    dataset provides the lyrics needed for the analysis and the Last.fm tags can
    be used to identify the genre of the songs.
    
    Summarizing, the data to be used is:
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The main MSD, only the IDs are used. There are 1M in the
            dataset and its uncompressed size is of about 280GB.
      \item The musiXmatch dataset has lyrics for almost 240k songs from the
            MSD. The reasons for the reduced size are: copyright, duplicates and
            instrumental tracks.
      \item The Last.fm dataset includes 94\% of the songs in the MSD, 50\% of
            them have at least one tag.
    \end{itemize}
